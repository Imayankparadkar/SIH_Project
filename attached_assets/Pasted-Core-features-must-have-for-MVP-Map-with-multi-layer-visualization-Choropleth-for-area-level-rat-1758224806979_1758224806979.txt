Core features (must-have for MVP)

Map with multi-layer visualization

Choropleth for area-level rates (cases per 1,000), heatmap for density, and clustered pins for individual reports.

Separate color per disease + intensity

Distinct hue per disease; saturation/opacity indicates case count or severity.

Search & autocomplete

Search by disease name (and synonyms), symptom, or place name. Fuzzy matching & auto-suggest.

Live location fetching

Browser Geolocation API with clear permission UI. Option: compute risk locally and send only coarse geohash to server.

Time slider / play animation

Browse historical spread; animate to show propagation.

Source & confidence

Each data point/area shows source badges (official lab, hospital, user report, news) and a computed confidence score.

Report a case / participatory reporting

Users can report symptoms/cases (with consent), optionally upload a photo/report ID; rate-limited and moderated.

Alerts & push notifications

Area-based opt-in alerts (new hotspot, sudden increases).

Admin dashboard

Validate/flag reports, edit source weights, set aggregation thresholds, publish official advisories.

Advanced features (phase 2+)

Hotspot detection (automated) using KDE or spatial statistics (Getis-Ord Gi*) and trend detection (z-score over sliding window).

Predictive risk index combining case counts, population density, vaccination rates, mobility.

Layer toggles: official lab-confirmed, syndromic (ED) data, participatory reports, news-derived signals.

Embeddable map widgets & APIs for local health departments.

Exportable data (CSV / GeoJSON) with aggregation controls for research.

UX & UI specifics (practical)

Top bar: disease selector (multi-select) + time-range picker + search box (place/disease).

Left panel (collapsible): legend, top affected areas, quick stats (cases, incidence rate, new cases today), list of recent reports with source badges.

Map controls: toggle layers (choropleth / heatmap / pins), cluster radius slider, opacity slider, time-play controls.

Tooltip on hover: area name, incidence rate, 7-day trend sparkline, top symptoms, sources & confidence.

Drill-down modal: when clicking an area — show timeline, demographics, nearest care centers, official guidance, “report” button.

Accessibility: keyboard navigation, colorblind-safe palette (use qualitative palettes and glyphs), ARIA labels, readable font sizes.
