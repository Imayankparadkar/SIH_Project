Project Flow:

1. User Onboarding
User registers in the app (details: name, age, gender, medical history, allergies, preferred language).
Selects doctor or nearby hospital for automatic report sharing.

Chooses notification preferences (diet reminders, emergency alerts, etc.).
Create or link an ABHA (Ayushman Bharat Health Account) if available (optional) for EHR portability. 

Optionally link: private insurance (PolicyBazaar-like onboarding) and/or government schemes (PM-JAY / Ayushman Bharat) — store policy IDs & consent for automated claim/eligibility checks.
